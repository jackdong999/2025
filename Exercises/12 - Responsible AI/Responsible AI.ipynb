    "# Responsible Use of Large Language Models 🔒🤖\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! In this notebook, you’ll explore how **large language models** can sometimes behave in unexpected or unsafe ways, and how we can study these behaviors responsibly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll start by looking at **jailbreaking**, where crafted prompts attempt to bypass a model’s safety constraints. Then you’ll examine how small changes in phrasing can reveal **biases and fairness issues** in model outputs. Along the way, you’ll experiment with real examples, compare responses, and learn how researchers evaluate the robustness of modern LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 What you’ll do\n",
    "- 🛡️ **Explore jailbreak techniques** → see how prompt structure can influence model behavior.  \n",
    "- ⚖️ **Investigate fairness** → compare how models respond to subtly different descriptions of people or situations.  \n",
    "- 🧪 **Run hands-on tests** → try out prompts, observe outputs, and analyze where models succeed or fail.  \n",
    "- 💬 **Reflect on implications** → understand why safety and bias matter when deploying NLP systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "✨ By the end, you’ll have a practical understanding of how and why LLMs can fail and what it means to evaluate them responsibly. Let’s get started!\n"

    "\n",
    "**Membership Inference Attacks (MIA)** aim to determine whether a specific data point—such as a sentence, personal record, or user-generated text—was part of a model’s training set. For LLMs, this means an adversary can potentially infer whether certain content was used during pretraining or fine-tuning.\n",

    "A common approach uses **Min-K% Prob**, a confidence-based metric that measures how sharply a model concentrates probability mass among its top predictions. Training examples often produce **noticeably sharper** probability distributions, making their top-K% mass significantly higher than that of non-members.\n",
