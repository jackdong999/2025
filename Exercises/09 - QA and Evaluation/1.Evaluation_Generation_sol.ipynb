    "Evaluation of Text Generation is a central challenge in natural language generation research. How we evaluate systems shapes not only model comparison but also our very definition of what counts as a “good” output. In this session, you will explore different types of evaluation metrics to uncover their strengths, limitations, and inherent biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is **not to chase perfect evaluation scores**, but to **experiment** and **build intuition** about how evaluation of text generation actually works.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You’re encouraged to:  \n",
    "- Try out different evaluation metrics from various classes,  \n",
    "- Compare how they rate the same model outputs, and  \n",
    "- Reflect on when and why these metrics agree—or fail to.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll focus on two main types of evaluation metrics:  \n",
    "(a) **Content-overlap metrics**   \n",
    "(b) **Model-based metrics**.  \n",

    "Beyond these automatic methods, you’re also encouraged to **manually evaluate** some generated outputs yourself — observe which metrics best align with your own intuition about quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you’ll have a practical understanding of how to **evaluate text generation models** and a clearer sense of **what good evaluation really means**."
