    "## 🧩 QA (Extractive, Generative) and RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll explore **Question Answering (QA)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** — two key paradigms for connecting large language models with factual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll begin with **Extractive QA**, where a model identifies an answer span directly from a passage using *sequence labeling* with a **BERT-style encoder**.  \n",
    "Then, we’ll move to **Generative QA**, where models like **BART** or **GPT** produce free-form answers in natural language, demonstrating greater flexibility but also higher risk of **hallucination**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we’ll discuss the **limitations** of both approaches — extractive QA can be rigid and context-limited, while generative QA may generate fluent but incorrect answers.  \n",
    "To address these issues, we’ll introduce **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, which enriches the model’s context with relevant external knowledge to improve **factuality** and **reduce hallucinations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is **not just to run QA models**, but to **understand their design trade-offs** and how retrieval-based methods can make generation more trustworthy and grounded in evidence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you’ll have a clear understanding of:\n",
    "- How extractive and generative QA differ in architecture and behavior,  \n",
    "- Why hallucination occurs in generative systems, and  \n",
    "- How RAG mitigates these issues by integrating retrieval with generation"
