These steps are often called thoughts as well. Thoughts or steps are the individual actions, each one an independent move in the solver’s attempt to work through the problem and reach the final answer. Reasoning can be segmented in different ways depending on the dataset or the solver’s style, but for our exercise we’ll keep it simple and treat each sentence in the reasoning as a single thought."
