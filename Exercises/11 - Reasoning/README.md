# 11 - Reasoning

In this tutorial you’ll explore how LLMs reason and act: first by testing different reasoning frameworks on the Game of 24, then by giving models tools they can call to perform real computations. You’ll see how structured reasoning and function calling turn LLMs from passive text generators into capable problem-solving agents.
