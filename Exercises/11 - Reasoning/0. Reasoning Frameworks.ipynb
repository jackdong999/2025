    "\n",
    "Welcome to this module on **reasoning frameworks for Large Language Models**.  \n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll explore how different prompting and inference strategies influence an LLM’s ability to solve a classic math reasoning task: the **Game of 24**.\n",

    "- A dataset of 24-puzzles  \n",

    "## 📘 The Game of 24 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Game of 24** is a classic arithmetic puzzle: Given **four numbers**, your goal is to combine them using the operations **+**, **−**, **×**, and **÷** (and parentheses) to make the value **24**.\n",

    "### 🧪 Verifying Student Solutions Programmatically\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you check whether a proposed solution to a Game of 24 puzzle is valid, we provide a small evaluation utility.  \n",
    "You won’t need to understand every detail of the code right away, just how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔍 What the Verifier Does\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation functions perform three main checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Is the solution “final”?**  \n",
    "   The code checks whether your sequence of steps ends in a legitimate final state — that is, you’ve produced a single expression without leftover numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Did you use the correct numbers?**  \n",
    "   Your final expression must use *exactly* the four numbers from the puzzle, no more and no fewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Does the expression equal 24?**  \n",
    "   Using SymPy, the tool evaluates your final expression safely and determines whether it results in 24.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧩 How You’ll Use It\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll call:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "is_terminal, reward = evaluate(steps, puzzle, current_state)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`steps`** is a list of strings describing the steps the student (or your algorithm) took  \n",
    "- **`puzzle`** is the original four-number puzzle as a string  \n",
    "- **`current_state`** the remaining (unsued) numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "**The function returns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`is_terminal`** whether the attempt reached a final state  \n",
    "- **`reward`**\n",
    "  - `1.0` if the final expression correctly evaluates to 24  \n",
    "  - `0.0` otherwise  \n",

    "\n",
    "For the Game of 24, each “thought” represents one arithmetic operation combining two numbers. A single ToT iteration typically involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generating candidate thoughts**  \n",
    "   The model proposes several possible intermediate expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluating those thoughts**  \n",
    "   Each candidate is scored based on how promising it looks (e.g., whether it simplifies the puzzle).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expanding the search**  \n",
    "   Promising thoughts become new states, which the model expands in the next round.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔎 Our Strategy: Breadth-First Search (BFS) ToT\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree of Thoughts can be implemented in different search styles (DFS, BFS, heuristic search, etc.).  \n",
    "In this notebook, **we will use the BFS version**, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expands all thoughts at a given depth before moving deeper  \n",
    "- Ensures we explore a broad range of possibilities early  \n",
    "- Helps avoid getting stuck in a poor branch too quickly  \n",
    "- Works well for relatively small search spaces like a 4-number puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "Using BFS gives us a controlled, systematic way to observe how the model reasons when allowed to explore multiple possibilities simultaneously.\n",
