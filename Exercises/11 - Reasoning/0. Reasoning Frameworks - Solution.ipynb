    "# 🧩 Reasoning with LLMs: Solving the Game of 24\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this module on **reasoning frameworks for Large Language Models**.  \n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll explore how different prompting and inference strategies influence an LLM’s ability to solve a classic math reasoning task: the **Game of 24**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A dataset of 24-puzzles  \n",
    "- Verification tools to check whether a solution is valid  \n",
    "- Groq as our inference engine for fast, iterative reasoning  \n",
    "- Several reasoning frameworks, including:  \n",
    "  - **Few-Shot Prompting**  \n",
    "  - **Chain of Thought (CoT)**  \n",
    "  - **ReAct (Reason + Act)**  \n",
    "  - **Tree of Thoughts (ToT) — BFS variant**\n",
    "\n",
    "As you progress, you’ll implement each framework yourself and compare how they perform on the same underlying task.  \n",

    "\n",
    "To help you check whether a proposed solution to a Game of 24 puzzle is valid, we provide a small evaluation utility.  \n",
    "You won’t need to understand every detail of the code right away — just how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔍 What the Verifier Does\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation functions perform three main checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Is the solution “final”?**  \n",
    "   The code checks whether your sequence of steps ends in a legitimate final state — that is, you’ve produced a single expression without leftover numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Did you use the correct numbers?**  \n",
    "   Your final expression must use *exactly* the four numbers from the puzzle, no more and no fewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Does the expression equal 24?**  \n",
    "   Using SymPy, the tool evaluates your final expression safely and determines whether it results in 24.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧩 How You’ll Use It\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll call:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "is_terminal, reward = evaluate(steps, puzzle, current_state)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`steps`** is a list of strings describing the steps the student (or your algorithm) took  \n",
    "- **`puzzle`** is the original four-number puzzle as a string  \n",
    "- **`current_state`** the remaining (unsued) numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "**The function returns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`is_terminal`** whether the attempt reached a final state  \n",
    "- **`reward`**\n",
    "  - `1.0` if the final expression correctly evaluates to 24  \n",
    "  - `0.0` otherwise  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔️ Example\n",
