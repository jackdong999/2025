    "# 🤖 Building AI Agents With Function Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you’ll learn how to turn a language model into an **agent**, a system that can not only talk, but also *act*.  \n",
    "We do this by giving the model **tools**: small functions it can call to do real work like math, weather lookup, currency conversion, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function calling is how modern LLMs connect to the outside world. Instead of guessing answers, the model can decide: “Ah, this needs a tool,” and then request exactly the function and arguments it needs.\n",

    "Your job in this notebook isn’t to write the tools themselves, those are provided. Your job is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define tool schemas  \n",
    "- Inform the model which tools exist  \n",
    "- Let the model choose when to use them  \n",
    "- Run the tool it requests  \n",
    "- Return the result so it can finish the response  \n",

    "- Both API calls are **cached**, so repeated queries are faster and avoid redundant network usage.\n",
    "- After getting the weather data, the tool:\n",
    "  - converts the temperature into the user’s preferred unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin),\n",
    "  - collects wind speed, wind direction, and timestamp,\n",
    "  - and returns a clean, structured summary containing the city, country, temperature, wind info, and time.\n",

    "  - performs the news search,\n",
    "  - checks for errors (e.g., missing API key, invalid query),\n",

    "\n",
    "You’ve now built several tools, connected them to a model, and experienced how function calling turns an LLM into an **agent** that can take actions instead of just generating text.  \n",
    "This process — defining tools → letting the model choose → executing → returning results, is the fundamental loop behind modern AI agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this notebook is only an introduction. Agents can become far more capable when you add elements like planning, memory, multi-step reasoning, safety constraints, and orchestration frameworks. If you want to dive deeper, here are some recommended resources:\n",
