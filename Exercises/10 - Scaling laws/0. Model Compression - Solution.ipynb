        "# Model Compression in Large Language Models 🧠⚡\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome! In this notebook, you’ll explore how **large language models (LLMs)** can be made smaller, faster, and more efficient through two powerful techniques:  \n",
        "**Knowledge Distillation** and **Quantization**.\n",
        "\n",
        "You’ll start by studying how a large, powerful “teacher” model can transfer its knowledge to a smaller “student” model, a process known as **distillation**.  \n",
        "Then you’ll see how **quantization** can further compress models by reducing numerical precision, cutting down memory use, and speeding up inference without major accuracy loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "We’ll focus on the **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** task, the same pretraining objective used for models like **BERT** and **DistilBERT**, and evaluate how both techniques preserve performance while improving efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔍 What you’ll do\n",
        "- 📚 **Learn key concepts** → understand what distillation and quantization mean, and why they matter for deploying LLMs.  \n",
        "- 🧩 **Load a real dataset** → use the **Yelp Polarity** dataset to work with natural, human-written text.  \n",
        "- 🧠 **Create masked samples** → hide random words and challenge models to fill in the blanks.  \n",
        "- ⚖️ **Compare teacher vs. student** → test how well **DistilBERT** imitates **BERT**.  \n",
        "- ⚡ **Quantize the teacher** → run BERT in 8-bit precision using **BitsAndBytes** to measure speed and accuracy changes.  \n",
        "- 📊 **Evaluate and visualize results** → compare predictions, agreement scores, KL divergence, and runtime performance.  \n",
        "\n",
        "✨ By the end, you’ll see how **distillation and quantization work together** to make modern language models leaner, faster, and easier to deploy — all while keeping their intelligence intact. Let’s get started!\n"
